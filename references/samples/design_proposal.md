# UI/UX Proposal: "Blue Sky" Theme (White Background)

Based on the gamified "Tap Trading" mechanics, the following "Blue Sky" theme is proposed to create a clean, trustworthy, and high-tech trading environment:

### 1. Color Palette (White/Blue)
- **Background:** Clean White (`#FFFFFF`) or ultra-light Slate (`#F8FAFC`).
- **Primary Action (Brand Blue):** Vivid Science Blue (`#3B82F6`) to replace the neon reds/yellows.
- **Accents:** Electric Cyan (`#06B6D4`) for active states, Deep Indigo (`#4338CA`) for high-contrast elements.
- **Grid Lines:** Very subtle Blue-Gray (`#E2E8F0`).
- **Text:** 
  - **Headings/Values:** Deep Slate (`#0F172A`) for maximum readability.
  - **Secondary:** Cool Gray (`#64748B`).

### 2. Element Styling
- **The "Blocks" (Positions):**
  - *Pending/Idle:* White fill with Blue outline (`border-2 border-blue-500`).
  - *Active/Selected:* Solid Blue fill (`bg-blue-600`) with white text/shadow.
  - *Winning:* **Crystal/Diamond Shard Explosion** (Blue/Cyan particles) instead of fire.
- **Price Line:** High-contrast **Hot Pink** (`#EC4899`) or **Bright Orange** (`#F97316`) to visually "pop" against the blue/white background.
- **Shadows:** Soft, diffused blue shadows (`shadow-lg shadow-blue-500/20`) to create depth without "dirty" gray shadows.

### 3. Atmosphere
- **Vibe:** "Clean Fintech" meets "Arcade Precision". Think medical-grade UI cleanliness with fast, responsive game feedback.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use Frost White (`bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md border-white/20`) for overlays and toasts.
